# Personal Portfolio Repository

This repository serves as version control for my Personal Portfolio found at www.dreysmith.dev . The site is contonuously updated with new artices and updated current info. Built with React, this portfolio was engineered with the intent of making changes easy. All data can be found in the src/data folder and can be modified from there to be presented throughout the site.
